          Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam 15 October 1931 ‚Äì 27 July 2015)
          was an Indian aerospace scientist who served as the 11th president of
          India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil
          Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next
          four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the
          Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space
          Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's
          civilian space programme and military missile development efforts. He
          thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the
          development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. He
          also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in
          India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original
          nuclear test by India in 1974.
